# Matrix Bot Template

## What is this?
* A simple, working NodeJS Bot (index.js)
* Sample chat commands (app.js)
* An Express inspired message 'routing' layer (chatMatcher.js)

## Why?
For some reason, Matrix seems to be hard.
This is a very simple example of a chat bot which can be butchered however.

## Requirements
* Node >=8.0.0
* NPM
* Valid accessToken and user name ()

## Running
Update config as per link above
```bash
> npm i
> npm start
```
